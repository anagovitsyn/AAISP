# AAISP - Automated AI Software Production

## Introduction
AAISP (**Automated AI Software Production**) is an emerging concept aimed at fully automating the software development lifecycle. This system takes **natural language technical specifications** as input and autonomously generates, tests, corrects, and deploys software products with minimal human intervention.

## Key Features
- **Specification-to-Code**: Converts natural language descriptions into working code.
- **Automated Testing & Iteration**: Generates and runs tests, iterating until the code is error-free.
- **Self-Correcting Mechanism**: AI fixes errors based on test results up to three times before requesting human intervention.
- **Deployment & Reporting**: Deploys a test version of the generated software and provides a report on key design decisions.

## Repository Structure
```
AAISP/
│── specs/                # Natural language technical specifications
│── codegen/              # AI-generated source code
│── tests/                # AI-generated test cases
│── corrections/          # Iterative fixes applied to failing code
│── deployment/           # Scripts for automated deployment
│── reports/              # Generated reports on decisions & iterations
│── README.md             # This file
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AAISP.git
   cd AAISP
   ```
2. Add your technical specifications to the `specs/` folder.
3. Run the AAISP pipeline (to be developed in future phases).

## Roadmap
- [ ] **AI Model Integration**: Selecting the best LLMs for code generation.
- [ ] **Testing & Debugging Module**: Implementing self-correcting logic.
- [ ] **Automated Deployment**: Enabling one-click test deployment.
- [ ] **Refinement & Optimization**: Improving efficiency and reliability.
